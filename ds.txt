"Changing a data structure in a slow program can work the same way an organ transplant does in a sick patient."

classification of ds
1.Contiguous and linked ds
Contiguous ds : Contigous slabs of memory
eg. array,heap,matrices and hashtables
linked ds : distinct chunks of memory bound together by pointers.
eg.list,trees,graph adjacency list

The relative advantages of linked lists over static arrays include:
• Overflow on linked structures can never occur unless the memory is actually full.
• Insertions and deletions are simpler than for contiguous (array) lists.
• With large records, moving pointers is easier and faster than moving the items themselves.
while the relative advantages of arrays include:
• Linked structures require extra space for storing pointer fields.
• Linked lists do not allow efficient random access to items.
• Arrays allow better memory locality and cache performance than random
pointer jumping.
memory locality : Physical continuity between successive data accesses helps to exploit the high speed cache memory on modern comp arch.
2.Stack,Queue and Dictionaries
permits storage and retrieval of data items independent of content. By contrast, dictionaries are abstract data types that retrieve based on key values or "content"

Each object has
